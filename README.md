## 🎯 What I Learned

This project helped me understand and practice several core concepts of Flutter development:

- ✅ **Widgets composition**: I created and reused custom widgets like `StandardCard`, `ContentIcon`, `RoundedButton`, and `Lowbutton` to build a clean interface.
- ✅ **State management**: I used `setState()` to dynamically update values like weight, age, and height in real time.
- ✅ **Navigation**: I implemented navigation between screens using `Navigator.push` and `Navigator.pop`.
- ✅ **UI Design**: I worked with `ThemeData`, `AppBarTheme`, `Slider`, `GestureDetector`, and layout widgets like `Column`, `Row`, and `Expanded`.
- ✅ **Constants management**: I organized style constants in a separate `consts.dart` file to keep the code clean and consistent.
- ✅ **Basic Dart OOP**: I created a `CalcIMC` class to handle BMI logic, including interpretation and formatted results.
